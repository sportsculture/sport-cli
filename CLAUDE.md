# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

sport-cli is an enhanced fork of Google's official Gemini CLI with multi-provider AI support. It's a command-line AI workflow tool built as a monorepo with:

- **Frontend**: React-based CLI using Ink for terminal UI
- **Backend**: TypeScript/Node.js handling multi-provider AI interactions
- **VSCode Extension**: IDE companion for integration
- **Origin**: Forked from [google-gemini/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

## Essential Development Commands

```bash
# Build & Development
npm install                 # Install dependencies
npm run build              # Build all packages
npm run build:all          # Build including sandbox
npm start                  # Run from source
npm run debug              # Start with debugging

# Testing & Quality - ALWAYS RUN BEFORE COMMITTING
npm run preflight          # Complete validation (build, test, lint, format)
npm run test               # Run unit tests
npm run test:e2e           # Run integration tests
npm run lint               # ESLint check
npm run format             # Prettier formatting

# Run a single test file
npm test -- path/to/test.test.ts
```

## Architecture & Code Organization

### Package Structure

- **`packages/cli`**: Terminal UI layer (React/Ink components, command processing)
- **`packages/core`**: Backend logic (provider integrations, tools, MCP support)
- **`packages/vscode-ide-companion`**: VSCode extension

### Key Design Patterns

- **Plain objects over classes** with TypeScript interfaces
- **Functional programming** patterns (map, filter, reduce)
- **React hooks** for state management and side effects
- **Co-located tests** (`.test.ts` files next to source)

### Provider Integration

The codebase supports multiple AI providers through a unified interface:

- Providers are implemented in `packages/core/src/providers/`
- Each provider implements the `Provider` interface
- Configuration is managed through settings.json and environment variables

### Tool System

Tools are the primary way the AI interacts with the system:

- Tool definitions in `packages/core/src/tools/`
- Each tool implements validation, execution, and formatting
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers can provide additional tools

## Configuration Hierarchy

1. **Environment Variables** (`.env`): API keys for providers
2. **Settings Files** (searched in order):
   - Project: `.sport/settings.json` (with fallback to `.gemini/settings.json` for compatibility)
   - User: `~/.sport/settings.json` (with fallback to `~/.gemini/settings.json`)
   - System: `/etc/sport-cli/settings.json`
3. **SPORT.md**: Instructional context files (hierarchical, with fallback to GEMINI.md)
4. **MCP Configuration**: `.mcp.json` for external tool servers

## Testing Guidelines

- Tests use **Vitest** with extensive mocking
- React components tested with `ink-testing-library`
- Mock patterns: Use `vi.mock()` for dependencies
- Integration tests in `/integration-tests`
- Always verify tests pass before implementing features

## Key Development Rules

1. **Never use underscores in flag names** - use hyphens instead
2. **Always run `npm run preflight`** before committing
3. **Keep React components pure** - no side effects in render
4. **Type everything** - avoid `any`, prefer `unknown`
5. **Test co-location** - keep `.test.ts` files next to source

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Provider

1. Create provider in `packages/core/src/providers/`
2. Implement the `Provider` interface
3. Add to provider factory
4. Add configuration types
5. Update documentation

### Adding a New Tool

1. Create tool in `packages/core/src/tools/`
2. Implement validation, execution, and formatting
3. Add to tool registry
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update help documentation

### Working with the UI

- Components in `packages/cli/src/components/`
- Use Ink's React components for terminal rendering
- Theme system in `packages/cli/src/utils/theme.ts`
- Keep components focused and testable

## Debugging Tips

- Use `npm run debug` for debugging with breakpoints
- Check logs in development mode
- Use `--debug` flag for verbose output
- Integration tests are helpful for complex scenarios

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches for new work
- Use worktrees for parallel development:
  ```bash
  npm run worktree:new
  npm run worktree:sync
  ```
- Commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.

## Fork Maintenance Guidelines

### Upstream Synchronization

This project is a fork that needs to stay synchronized with Google's gemini-cli:

```bash
# One-time setup
git remote add upstream https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli.git

# Regular sync process
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main  # Preferred for clean history
# Resolve conflicts carefully
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

### Code Isolation Strategy

To minimize merge conflicts:

1. **Provider System**: All multi-provider logic is isolated in `packages/core/src/providers/`
   - `provider.interface.ts` - Common interface all providers implement
   - `gemini.provider.ts` - Original Gemini logic refactored as a provider
   - `openrouter.provider.ts` - OpenRouter integration
   - `provider.factory.ts` - Provider selection logic

2. **Minimal Injection Points**: We modify original code in as few places as possible
   - Look for comments like `// sport-cli: provider injection`
   - Keep these modifications surgical and well-documented

3. **Configuration Over Code**: Use configuration files for branding
   - `src/config/branding.ts` - Centralized branding configuration
   - Avoid hardcoding "sport" or package names throughout the codebase

### Adding New Features

When adding sport-cli specific features:

1. **Isolate in dedicated directories** whenever possible
2. **Use feature flags** for experimental features
3. **Document injection points** where you must modify original code
4. **Write comprehensive tests** to catch regressions during merges

### Handling Conflicts

When conflicts arise during upstream sync:

1. **Provider code**: Always keep our version (it's our added value)
2. **Core gemini code**: Generally take upstream unless we have critical fixes
3. **Tests**: Merge both sets of tests
4. **Dependencies**: Carefully merge, ensuring our added dependencies remain

### Contributing Back Upstream

Consider contributing these improvements back to Google:

1. **Provider abstraction layer** (without specific providers)
2. **General architectural improvements**
3. **Bug fixes that affect original functionality**
4. **Test improvements**

Open an issue first to discuss before creating PRs.

## Important Files to Know

- `packages/core/src/conversation/index.ts` - Core conversation logic
- `packages/core/src/providers/index.ts` - Provider management
- `packages/core/src/tools/index.ts` - Tool system

## OpenRouter Rankings Scraper

The project includes a web scraper for OpenRouter model rankings:

### Location
- `scripts/rankings-scraper/` - Scraper directory

### Key Files
- `scrape-programming-rankings.ts` - Main scraper that fetches live rankings from OpenRouter
- `update-gist.ts` - Updates GitHub gist with scraped data
- `generate-mock-data.ts` - Generates test data for development
- `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions for rankings data

### Usage

```bash
# Scrape live rankings from OpenRouter
cd scripts/rankings-scraper
npx tsx scrape-programming-rankings.ts

# Update the gist with new data
npx tsx update-gist.ts real-live-rankings.json

# Generate mock data for testing
npx tsx generate-mock-data.ts
```

### Data Storage
- Rankings are stored in a GitHub gist: https://gist.github.com/sportsculture/a8f3bac998db4178457d3bd9f0a0d705
- The gist is updated via GitHub API using environment variables:
  - `GIST_ID` - The gist ID
  - `GH_TOKEN` - GitHub personal access token

### How It Works
1. `scrape-programming-rankings.ts` uses Puppeteer to navigate OpenRouter's rankings page
2. Extracts model rankings, token usage, and growth metrics
3. Maps display names to actual OpenRouter model IDs using verified mappings
4. Data is saved to JSON and uploaded to the gist for persistence

### Important Notes
- The scraper extracts display names from the website (e.g., "Claude Sonnet 4", "GPT-5")
- These are mapped to real OpenRouter API model IDs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `openai/gpt-5`)
- Model ID mappings are verified against the OpenRouter API (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`)
- The gist contains the corrected model IDs that can be used with the OpenRouter API
